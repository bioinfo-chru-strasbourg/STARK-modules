Version 2.0 original 

 Version 2.1 released 03-24-04 by P.Ng 
Added info_on_seqs "-" option to print out SIFT scores for entire protein.
Updated Alignment.c to prevent segmentation fault if multiple blank lines in
  PSI-BLAST output file.

Version 2.1.1 released 01-10-07
No software changes. Changed README notes for accurate description on how
to run info_on_seqs by commandline. 

Version 2.1.2 released 05-31-07
Change cccb to compile correctly with blimps 8
Change directons for sed and to download blimps 8

Version 3.0 released 3-19-08
Allow sequence retrieval from BLink
(This uses precomputed NCBI BLAST searches, and can be a huge timesaver)

Version 4.0 released 11-23-09
Allows exome scale single nucleotide variant characterization and prediction (SIFT_exome_nssnvs.pl)
Allows exome scale insertion/deletion variant characterization               (SIFT_exome_indels.pl)
For instructions on how to use these tools, please see README_4.0

VERSION 4.0.1 released 01-22-10 
Retrieving sequences by gi reported to not be working. Fix get_BLINK_seq.pl script .
Added SIFT_intersect_cds.pl so that users can filter out noncoding variants out of 
  large genomic variant genomic lists.

VERSION 4.0.2 released February 5, 2010
Fix strand orientation in snv_db_engine.pl

VERSION 4.0.3 released March 8, 2010
Change snv_db_engine to match SIFT website
Clarify instructions  for SIFT_exome_indels.pl and SIFT_intersect_cds.pl 
Make available web tools
