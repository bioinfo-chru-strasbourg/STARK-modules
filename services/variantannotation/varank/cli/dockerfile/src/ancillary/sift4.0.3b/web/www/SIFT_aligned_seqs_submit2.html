<FORM ENCTYPE="MULTIPART/FORM-DATA" METHOD="POST" ACTION="/sift-bin/SIFT_aligned_seqs_submit2.pl">
Submit your query sequence along with other protein sequences that are aligned to it for SIFT.  Your query sequence is the sequence that you would like prediction on (i.e. the sequence in which you have introduced the amino acid substitutions). <b> 
The query sequence should be first in the alignment.
  The alignment must correspond to the length of your query sequence (i.e. no gaps in your query sequence in the alignment).</b>
Partial sequences should be flanked by Xes at the beginning and end of the sequence so that those positions are not considered gaps (and hence have liberal prediction).

<i>Entering sequences </i><BR>
Enter your query sequence aligned with related sequences. These sequences are assumed to be functional, and is what SIFT will base its prediction on. The normal (functional) query sequence should appear first.
