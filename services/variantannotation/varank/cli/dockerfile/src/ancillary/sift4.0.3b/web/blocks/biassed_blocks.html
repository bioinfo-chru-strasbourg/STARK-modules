Compositionally biassed blocks are made up of sequence segments rich 
in a few amino acids or short repeats. 
Biassed blocks are not
neccesarily misaligned. Some conserved protein regions are rich in 
charged residues, like basic-zipper transcription factors, or in hydrophobic
amino acids, like transmembranal regions.
However, blocks biassed toward the same amino acid(s) can give a significant 
<A HREF="/blocks-bin/LAMA_search.sh">LAMA</A> (block to block alignment) 
score, even without being biologically related.
<P>
Biassed blocks have a high number of columns similar to one another.
Such a block can be identified by comparing all of its columns with
each other, clumping those columns sharing high pairwise scores, and counting 
the number of columns in the largest clump.
<P>
Two parameters are used: 
which pairwise column score is considered "high" and
what fraction of columns in the largest clump is considered "high".
The column comparison measure used is the normalized sum of products (p).
p(A,B) is the sum of A(i)*B(i) for all i amino acids (20) in block 
columns A and B (actually <A HREF="help/PSSM_def.html">PSSM</A>
columns).
About 5% of the blocks in the Blocks+ (10 June 2000) database were judged
biassed using the default parameters of 0.50 for the cutoff pairwise column
score and 25% of columns in the largest clump of columns.
