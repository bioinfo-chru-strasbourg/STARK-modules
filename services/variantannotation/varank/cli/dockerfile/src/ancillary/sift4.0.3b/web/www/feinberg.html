Substitution at pos 198 from G to W is predicted to <font color=red>AFFECT PROTEIN FUNCTION</font> with a score of 0.02.
    Median sequence conservation: 4.32
    Sequences represented at this position:15
<font color=red>WARNING!!</font>  This substitution may have been predicted to affect function just because 
 the sequences used were not diverse enough.  <b>There is LOW CONFIDENCE in this prediction.</b>

Substitution at pos 384 from A to T is predicted to be TOLERATED with a score of 1.00.
    Median sequence conservation: 3.95
    Sequences represented at this position:19
