CONFIG -- BLIMPS configuration file keys and allowed values.



Configuration file fields and other information.

The field keys are case insensitive and only depend on the first two
characters. The fields are space-delimited.
The only keys required in the configuration file are:

	* To search a sequence vs a blocks database: SQ, DB, //
	* To search a block vs a sequence database:  BL, DB, //
	* To search a matrix vs a sequence database: MA, DB, //

You will usually want to also specify an output file (OU).


SQ	Sequence file filename. DNA sequences are translated to
	protein for searching (see GE and ST). Blimps decides
	whether a sequence is DNA or protein based on composition.

BL	Block file filename. BLIMPS converts the block to a
        position-specific scoring matrix (see CO).

MA	Precomputed position-specific scoring matrix file filename.

DB	Database file filename. Either a database of blocks, or
	a database of sequences (DNA or protein).

OU	The output file filename.  Standard output is the default if
	no OU field is given.

//	End of the configuration file.  Anything after this field is
	ignored. 

-----------------------Optional fields-------------------------------------

FR	Frequency file filename. Default is $BLIMPS_DIR/docs/default.*.frq
	depending on the sequence type (DNA or protein). These are the
	background frequencies of the various residues.

NU	The number of scores to report.  A number less than zero means
	to report all the scores.  A number of zero means to judge the
	number to report based on the query block or sequence.  A
	number greater than zero is the number to actually report.
	The default value is zero.

HI	Print a histogram of the search scores. Values are case insensitive.
	True, t, yes, y, or a number != 0 means to print the
	histogram.  The default behavior is not to print the histogram
	values.  The histogram is printed in the output file.

RE	If repeats are allowed in the scoring list; if not then only
	the highest scoring alignment of the block with the sequence
	is saved. True, t, yes, y, or a number != 0 means that
	all alignments are saved.
        The default is that repeats are allowed.

GE      The Genetic code to use for translation of DNA sequences.
        The standard genetic code is the default.
        The allowed genetic codes are:
		0 - Standard (default)
		1 - Vertebrate Mitochondrial
		2 - Yeast Mitochondrial
		3 - Mold Mitochondrial and Mycoplasma
		4 - Invertebrate Mitochondrial
		5 - Ciliate Macronuclear
		6 - Protozoan Mitochondrial
		7 - Plant Mitochondrial
		8 - Echinodermate Mitochondrial

ST	The number of strands to translate and search for
	nucleotide sequence.  A value of 2 means that both strands are
	to be searched.  A value of 1 means just the forward strand and
	a value of -1 just the reverse strand.  The default value is 2.

ER	Error level;  defaults to value 2.  The field is
	a number.  Errors of lesser value than the error level are not
	reported.  The recommendation is to put this in the first line
	of the configuration file to catch all the configuration file
	errors.  The program will always handle a fatal error regardless
	of the error level setting.  The different error levels are:  
	1 - info "error"  - General information.
	2 - warning error - Probable user error.
                            Generally recoverable.
	3 - serious error - Probable user error.
                            Difficult to recover from.
	4 - program error - Programming error, problem should have
                            been caught before it arose.
                            Recoverability varies.
	5 - fatal error   - Various causes, user or programmer.
                            Unable to recover from.
                            Exits program with the fatal error level
			    value (5).
 
CO	Conversion method for converting a block to a matrix.  The
	field value is a number, the default is 3:
		0 - Odds ratios with clustering. Same as the original
		    Patmat method, but
		    cleaner and without the negative fields in the
		    frequency file.  It also does a weighted average of
		    D & N to get B and of E & Q to get Z.  If a B or Z
		    is encountered, it is split between D & N or E & Q.
		1 - uses old Patmat method, needs -1 and -2 in the frequency
		    file - gets weird numbers due to division by zero
		    if there are zeros in the frequency file. For 
		    compatibility testing only, not recommended.
		2 - Odds ratios with explicit sequence weighting. The same as
		    clustering except that the weights of the sequences
		    are taken explicitly from the blocks, rather
		    than implicitly from the clustering.
		    If explicit sequence weights are not found in the block
		    position-based sequence weights are calculated.
		3 - Log odds ratios with explicit sequence weighting, plus
		    substitution probability pseudo-counts. 
		    If explicit sequence weights are not found in the block
		    position-based sequence weights are calculated.
		    Requires a substitution probability matrix, default
		    is $BLIMPS_DIR/docs/default.qij, and a multiplier
		    value, default is 5.0. Alternatives can be used by
		    adding this additonal line to the configuration file
		    (see OP below):
			OP alts: 5.0 default.qij :alts

OP      Options for algorithms in the code.  This is how additional
	options are passed to specific algorithms.  To pass an option
	begin and end the options with the algorithm's key and a
	colon.  For example for the algorithms with the key "alts"
	use: 
  
	OPtions  	alts: 5.0 ../docs/default.qij :alts

	Options:
	  alts: Altchul's substitution probability pseudo-count method
		first parameter -- total pseudo-count multiplier, 5.0
				   is the recommended value 
		second parameter -- the substitution probability matrix file

EX	Export matrix (matrices) to filename.  The matrix (matrices)
	are output to the specified file name.  If this field is absent,
	no matrix output is given.

SE	Old configuration file field.  Left for backward
	compatibility.  The type of search to do, either "block" or
	"matrix".  The field is case insensitive.

TY	Sequence type. AA or DNA. Specify DNA if you want to make sure Blimps
	translates your sequence query or database of sequences and AA if
	you want to make sure it does not translate. By default, Blimps
	will use this alogorithm to decide the sequence type:
		if the sequence contains EFILPQ, then protein
		else if is >85% ACGTU, then DNA
		     else protein

Different search types:
Matrix:		Compares the block file against the database files.
Block:		Compares the sequence file against the database files.
Any others:	Compares the block file(s) against the sequence
		files(s). 


Determination of the search type:
Note that if the SE field is given blimps will try to do that kind of
search regardless of the other fields given. 

Matrix (compares a block or precomputed site specific scoring matrix
vs a sequence database): 
	BL or MA and DB
	BL or MA and SQ with SE = matrix.
Block (compares a sequence vs a block or precomputed site specific
scoring matrix database):
	SQ and DB or MA
	SQ and BL or MA with SE = block.
Unknown (compares a sequence "database" against a block "database":
	BL or MA, SQ, and DB (only uses BL or MA and SQ)
	BL or MA and SQ with no SE field
	SE field without "block" or "matrix" and two of SQ, BL, and DB
Can't continue:
	Only one of BL or MA, SQ, or DB is given

If the DB, BL or MA, and SQ fields are present, the search type is set
to UNKNOWN. 

Precomputed site specific scoring matrices and blocks cannot be
compared against each other using Blimps, but the LAMA system will do
this:	http://blocks.fhcrc.org/
