<H1><Center> Getting a Subfamily Block from a Protein Sequence </Center></H1>
<BR>
<i>Motivation:</i>
<P>
Given a protein sequence, the blocks returned by either <A HREF="/blocks/blocks_search.html">Block Searcher</A>  or <A HREF="/blocks/impala.html">IMPALA</A> are from the <A HREF="/blocks/blocks_release.html">Blocks database</A> which contains conserved regions from large protein families.
</P> 
To get blocks more specific to the query protein sequence, it would be better the make blocks from a subfamily of sequences rather than the entire family.  
The <A HREF="seq_to_subfamily_block.html">sequence to subfamily block webpage</A> automatically determines a clade of closely related sequences and returns the blocks from those sequences.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
The procedure occurs in 3 steps.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>1.  <i><big>Getting the Sequences</big></i></b>
<p> A <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">Psiblast search </A>(4 iterations, cutoff E-value for inclusion .002) is executed on the query sequence to find closely related sequences.
</p>
<b>2.  <i><big>Selecting Closely Related Sequences</big></i></b>
<p>
 Sequences found from (1) are clumped at 90% and <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=1689055&dopt=Abstract">MOTIF</A> is run on these clusters to find the conserved regions.  Using these conserved regions, sequences are added until average information per residue decreases.
 The sequences selected tend to form a clade in the family to which the sequence belongs to.
</p>
<b>3.  <i><big>Making the blocks</big></i></b>
<BR>
<p>  The regions identified by MOTIF for the selected sequences are returned.
<!--<A HREF = "http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?db=m&form=6&Dopt=r&uid=96066614"> BlockMaker</A> is executed on the sequences selected from (2) and the blocks are returned. -->
