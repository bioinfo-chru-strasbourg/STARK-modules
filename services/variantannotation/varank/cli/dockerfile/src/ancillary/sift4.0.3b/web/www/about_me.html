Hello!<BR>
<BR>
I am the author of <A HREF="SIFT.html">SIFT</A>, an algorithm that predicts whether an amino acid change affects protein function.  
I also constructed <A HREF="PHAT.html">PHAT</A>, a substitution scoring matrix especially for transmembrane proteins. These works were done with Dr. Steven Henikoff at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and constitute my Bioengineering PhD thesis from University of Washington, which I received in 2002. <BR>
<BR>
Then I worked at <A HREF="http://www.illumina.com">Illumina</A>, a microarray company, for 4 years.  I selected the SNPs for the Human-1, HumanHap300, HumanHap240S, HumanHap500, and HumanHap650Y <A HREF="http://www.illumina.com/products/snp/whole_genome_genotyping.ilmn">beadchips</A>. These beadchips allow human geneticists to perform genome-wide association studies. It is going to be incredibly exciting to see what comes out of these beadchips in the next couple of years. 
I also consulted for <A HREF="http://www.questdiagnostics.com/brand/business/b_bus_ni_index.html">Quest Diagnostics/Nichols Institute</A HREF>.  
<BR>
<BR>
I am now in the Human Genome Medicine group at the <A HREF="http://www.venterinstitute.org">Venter Institute</A> in Rockville, Maryland.   

And of course, I still maintain the SIFT website in my free time. <IMG SRC="smile.happy.gif" width=20 height=20> <BR>
<BR>
I love to learn new things and to be challenged.  I am always open to new opportunities
